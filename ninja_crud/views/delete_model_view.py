class DeleteModelView(AbstractModelView):
    """
    A view class that handles deleting a specific instance of a model.
    It allows customization through pre- and post-delete hooks and also supports decorators.

    Example:
    ```python
    from ninja_crud import views, viewsets

    from examples.models import Department

    class DepartmentViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        model = Department

        # Usage: Delete a department by id
        # DELETE /{id}/
        delete_department = views.DeleteModelView()
    ```

    Note:
        The attribute name (e.g., `delete_department`) is flexible and customizable.
        It serves as the name of the route and the operation id in the OpenAPI schema.

                If not provided, the function will be a no-op.
            path (str, optional): The path to use for the view. Defaults to "/{id}". Must include a "{id}" parameter.
            decorators (Optional[List[Callable]], optional): A list of decorators to apply to the view. Defaults to [].
            router_kwargs (Optional[dict], optional): Additional arguments to pass to the router. Defaults to {}.
