![Django Ninja CRUD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbakri/django-ninja-crud/main/docs/assets/images/django-ninja-crud-cover.png)

Django Ninja CRUD is an opinionated and powerful framework that accelerates the development of **CRUD** ([**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)) operations with [Django Ninja](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja), promoting best practices for efficient, robust endpoint creation.
Equally significant is its integrated testing suite: a robust, user-friendly toolset ensuring that your endpoints are not only swiftly constructed but also meticulously tested and validated, reflecting a commitment to quality and reliability in your development workflow.

## ⚡️ Key Features

- **Streamlined Setup**: With just a few lines of code, your **CRUD** operations are ready to roll. No more copy-pasting or reinventing the wheel for each project.
- **Focus on What Matters**: Spend your precious time solving real problems, not stitching together basic operations. Django Ninja CRUD is like a trusty sidekick, handling the routine while you strategize the big picture.
- **Reliable Code**: Predefined blueprints are battle-tested and developer-approved. They're customizable, transparent, and designed with best practices in mind.
- **Integrated Testing Framework**: A robust, user-friendly toolset ensures that your endpoints are not only swiftly constructed but also meticulously tested and validated, reflecting a commitment to quality and reliability in your development workflow.

## 📈 Installation
```bash
pip install django-ninja-crud
```
For more information, see the [installation guide](https://github.com/hbakri/django-ninja-crud/wiki/02_installation).

## 👨‍🎨 Example
### Usage
Let's imagine you're building a system for a university and you have a model called `Department`. Each department in your university has a unique title.

```python
# examples/models.py
from django.db import models

class Department(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
```

To interact with this data, we need a way to convert it between Python objects and a format that's easy to read and write (like JSON). In Django Ninja, we do this with `Schema`:

```python
# examples/schemas.py
from ninja import Schema

class DepartmentIn(Schema):
    title: str

class DepartmentOut(Schema):
    id: int
    title: str
```

The `DepartmentIn` schema defines what data we need when creating or updating a department. The `DepartmentOut` schema defines what data we'll provide when retrieving a department.

Now, here comes the power of Django Ninja CRUD. With it, you can set up the **CRUD** operations for the `Department` model with just a few lines of code:

```python
# examples/views/department_views.py
from django.http import HttpRequest
from ninja import Router
from ninja_crud import views, viewsets

from examples.models import Department
from examples.schemas import DepartmentIn, DepartmentOut

router = Router()


class DepartmentViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    model = Department
    default_input_schema = DepartmentIn
    default_output_schema = DepartmentOut

    list_view = views.ListModelView()
    create_view = views.CreateModelView()
    retrieve_view = views.RetrieveModelView()
    update_view = views.UpdateModelView()
    delete_view = views.DeleteModelView()


# The register_routes method must be called to register the routes with the router
DepartmentViewSet.register_routes(router)


# The router can then be used as normal
@router.get("/{name}", response=DepartmentOut)
def get_department_by_name(request: HttpRequest, name: str):
    return Department.objects.get(name=name)
```

### Testing
A key advantage of this package is that it makes your views easy to test. Once you've set up your **CRUD** operations, you can write tests to ensure they're working as expected. Here's an example of how you might test the `Department` operations:

```python
# examples/tests/test_department_views.py
from ninja_crud.testing.core.components import PathParameters, Payloads
from ninja_crud.testing.views import (
    CreateModelViewTest,
    DeleteModelViewTest,
    ListModelViewTest,
    RetrieveModelViewTest,
    UpdateModelViewTest,
)
from ninja_crud.testing.viewsets import ModelViewSetTestCase

from examples.models import Department
from examples.views.department_views import DepartmentViewSet


class TestDepartmentViewSet(ModelViewSetTestCase):
    model_viewset_class = DepartmentViewSet  # The viewset class to test
    base_path = "api/departments"  # The base path for the routes in the viewset

    @classmethod
    def setUpTestData(cls):
        super().setUpTestData()
        cls.department_1 = Department.objects.create(title="department-1")
        cls.department_2 = Department.objects.create(title="department-2")

    def get_path_parameters(self):
        return PathParameters(ok={"id": self.department_1.id}, not_found={"id": 9999})

    payloads = Payloads(
        ok={"title": "department-3"},
        bad_request={"wrong_field": "wrong_value"},
        conflict={"title": "department-2"},
    )

    test_list_view = ListModelViewTest()
    test_create_view = CreateModelViewTest(payloads=payloads)
    test_retrieve_view = RetrieveModelViewTest(path_parameters=get_path_parameters)
    test_update_view = UpdateModelViewTest(path_parameters=get_path_parameters, payloads=payloads)
    test_delete_view = DeleteModelViewTest(path_parameters=get_path_parameters)

    # You can then add additional tests as needed
    def test_get_department_by_name(self):
        response = self.client.get(f"{self.base_path}/department-1")
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        ... # Additional assertions
```
With this package, these tests can be written in a consistent, straightforward way, making it easier to ensure your views are working as expected.
