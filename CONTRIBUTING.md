# Contributing to Your Project

Firstly, thank you for considering contributing to Django Ninja CRUD! It's people like you that make an open source project such a great tool. We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with:

- **Q&A**: just answering questions that people have on the issues
- **Docs**: improve the documentation, no matter how small! If you find a typo, please let us know!
- **Testing**: if you like the project, just try to use it and report any bugs or uncomfortable things you see.
- **Code**: have a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.

### Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests into smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

## Code, commit message and labeling conventions

We use [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) as coding and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) as commit convention, and we use a set of labels for categorizing issues and pull requests.
