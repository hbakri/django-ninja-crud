# üåû How It Works

Let's imagine you're building a system for a university and you have a model called `Department`. Each department in your university has a unique title.

```python
# examples/models.py
from django.db import models

class Department(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
```

To interact with this data, we need a way to convert it between Python objects and a format that's easy to read and write (like JSON). In Django Ninja, we do this with `Schema`:

```python
# examples/schemas.py
from ninja import Schema

class DepartmentIn(Schema):
    title: str

class DepartmentOut(Schema):
    id: int
    title: str
```

The `DepartmentIn` schema defines what data we need when creating or updating a department. The `DepartmentOut` schema defines what data we'll provide when retrieving a department.

Now, here comes the power of the package. With it, you can set up the **CRUD**
operations for the `Department` model with just a few lines of code:

```python
# examples/views/department_views.py
from typing import List
from django.http import HttpRequest
from ninja import NinjaAPI
from ninja_crud import views, viewsets

from examples.models import Department
from examples.schemas import DepartmentIn, DepartmentOut

api = NinjaAPI()


class DepartmentViewSet(viewsets.APIViewSet):
    api = api
    model = Department

    list_departments = views.ListView(
        response_body=List[DepartmentOut]
    )
    create_department = views.CreateView(
        request_body=DepartmentIn,
        response_body=DepartmentOut,
    )
    read_department = views.ReadView(
        response_body=DepartmentOut
    )
    update_department = views.UpdateView(
        request_body=DepartmentIn,
        response_body=DepartmentOut,
    )
    delete_department = views.DeleteView()


# Beyond the CRUD operations managed by the viewset,
# the api or router can be used in the standard Django Ninja way
@api.get("/statistics/", response=dict)
def get_department_statistics(request: HttpRequest):
    return {"total": Department.objects.count()}
```

And if your viewset is as simple as the one above, you can leverage the `APIViewSet`
class to define it in a more concise way, with default request and response bodies:
```python
# examples/views/department_views.py
from ninja import NinjaAPI
from ninja_crud import views, viewsets

from examples.models import Department
from examples.schemas import DepartmentIn, DepartmentOut

api = NinjaAPI()


class DepartmentViewSet(viewsets.APIViewSet):
    api = api
    model = Department
    default_request_body = DepartmentIn
    default_response_body = DepartmentOut

    list_departments = views.ListView()
    create_department = views.CreateView()
    read_department = views.ReadView()
    update_department = views.UpdateView()
    delete_department = views.DeleteView()
```

# ‚òîÔ∏è Scenario-based Testing

Django Ninja CRUD integrates seamlessly with [Django REST Testing](https://github.com/hbakri/django-rest-testing),
and ensures comprehensive coverage and robust validation of your CRUD endpoints. At
first, the testing framework was part of this package, but it was later extracted
to its own package to allow for more flexibility and to be used with other Django
REST frameworks than Django Ninja.

With this package, you can:
- **Declaratively Define Test Scenarios**: Specify expected request and response details for each scenario, making your tests self-documenting and easy to understand.
- **Test Diverse Conditions**: Validate endpoint behaviors under various conditions, including valid and invalid inputs, nonexistent resources, and custom business rules.
- **Enhance Clarity and Maintainability**: Break tests into modular, manageable units, improving code organization and reducing technical debt.
- **Ensure Comprehensive Coverage**: Rigorously test your endpoints, leaving no stone unturned, thanks to the scenario-based approach.

To handle exceptions like `ObjectDoesNotExist` and return appropriate responses in your
tests, you can define an exception handler like this:

```python
# examples/exception_handlers.py
from ninja import NinjaAPI
from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist

api = NinjaAPI()


@api.exception_handler(ObjectDoesNotExist)
def handle_object_does_not_exist(request, exc):
    return api.create_response(
        request,
        {"message": "ObjectDoesNotExist", "detail": str(exc)},
        status=404,
    )

# ... other exception handlers
```

Now, you can write tests for your CRUD views using the scenario-based testing framework:

```python
# examples/tests/test_department_views.py
from examples.models import Department
from examples.schemas import DepartmentOut

from ninja_crud.testing import APITestCase, APIViewTestScenario


class TestDepartmentViewSet(APITestCase):
    department: Department

    @classmethod
    def setUpTestData(cls):
        cls.department = Department.objects.create(title="department")

    def test_read_department(self):
        self.assertScenariosSucceed(
            method="GET",
            path="/api/departments/{id}",
            scenarios=[
                APIViewTestScenario(
                    path_parameters={"id": self.department.id},
                    expected_response_status=200,
                    expected_response_body_type=DepartmentOut,
                    expected_response_body={
                        "id": self.department.id,
                        "title": self.department.title,
                    },
                ),
                APIViewTestScenario(
                    path_parameters={"id": 9999},
                    expected_response_status=404,
                ),
            ],
        )
```

By combining Django Ninja CRUD's declarative views with Django REST Testing's
scenario-based testing capabilities, you can confidently build and maintain robust,
well-tested RESTful APIs with ease.
