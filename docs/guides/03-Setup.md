# ⚙️ Setup

Django Ninja CRUD requires no specific setup! It seamlessly integrates with your existing Django Ninja projects, allowing you to start defining your CRUD endpoints and tests right away.

Like with any REST framework, you still need to define exceptions handling, authentication, and permissions in your Django Ninja project. Django Ninja CRUD does not interfere with these aspects, allowing you to manage them as you see fit.
