Django Ninja CRUD is a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming), powerful, and yet opinionated framework that simplifies the development of **CRUD** ([**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)) views and tests with [Django Ninja](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja).
It promotes best practices for efficient, robust endpoint creation, allowing you to focus on what matters most: solving real problems.
Initially inspired by DRF's [ModelViewSet](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#modelviewset), Django Ninja CRUD evolved to address its limitations, adopting a [composition-over-inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) approach to achieve true modularity ‚Äì a foundational step towards a broader declarative interface for endpoint creation.

# ‚ú® Key Features
- **Purely Declarative**: Embrace an approach where defining views and tests is a matter of declaring what you want, not how to achieve it.
- **Unmatched Modularity**: Tailor your viewsets with the desired CRUD views and customize each view's behavior with ease. Extend the flexibility by creating your own subclasses of the provided views and tests.
- **Powerful Testing Framework**: Leverage a matrix-based testing framework for defining diverse test scenarios declaratively.
- **Focus on What Matters**: Spend more time solving real-world problems and less on CRUD boilerplate.

Its blend of declarative syntax, modularity, and powerful testing capabilities sets a new standard for developers seeking efficiency and precision.

> **Django Ninja CRUD is not just a tool; it's a paradigm shift in Django web application development and testing.**
