**Django Ninja CRUD** introduces [**modularity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) to API development with [**Django Ninja**](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja), revolutionizing how APIs are built and maintained at scale while avoiding repetition. It empowers developers to create reusable, [**composable**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability) API views ranging from built-in [**CRUD** (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations to complex custom endpoints, supporting both sync and async implementations, all with minimal boilerplate code.

# üåû Key Features
- **Modular Views**: Easily extend `APIView` to create reusable components for repeated business logic. Define views by stating intent, with unrestricted function signatures supporting both sync and async implementations.

- **Flexible Built-in CRUD Views**: Pre-built, customizable `ListView`, `CreateView`, `ReadView`, `UpdateView`, and `DeleteView` views. Use as-is, customize, or use as blueprints for your own implementations. Supports any path parameters, pagination, filtering, decorators, and more.

- **Powerful Viewset Composition**: Use views independently or compose them into `APIViewSet` for grouped, related views sharing attributes. Design versatile APIs supporting multiple instances of the same view type‚Äîperfect for API versioning, or alternative representations.

- **Seamless Django Ninja Integration**: Enhance your existing Django Ninja project without changing its structure. Gradually adopt declarative views to clean up your codebase and boost development efficiency.

> Django Ninja CRUD emerged from countless hours of wrestling with repetitive, complex
> and hard-to-maintain APIs. My vision is to address those common pain points by
> providing a declarative and modular approach, making API development not just more
> efficient, but truly intuitive and enjoyable. I hope it revolutionizes your
> development experience as it has mine.
