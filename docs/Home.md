![Django Ninja CRUD](./django-ninja-crud-cover.png)

Django Ninja CRUD is a powerful tool designed to streamline the development of **CRUD** (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) operations in Django applications using the [Django Ninja](https://django-ninja.rest-framework.com) framework. It is intended to help developers save significant time by eliminating the need to write repetitive code for each operation and even more on the associated tests.

Developing these features from scratch every time can be _time-consuming_ and _error-prone_. That's where Django Ninja CRUD comes inâ€”it provides a set of predefined, customizable "blueprints" for these operations, allowing developers to set them up quickly and reliably. Instead of getting bogged down with the details of how these operations are performed, developers can focus on the unique, creative aspects of their applications.
