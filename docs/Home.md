Django Ninja CRUD is an opinionated and powerful framework that accelerates the development of **CRUD** ([**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)) operations with [Django Ninja](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja), promoting best practices for efficient, robust endpoint creation.
Equally significant is its integrated testing suite: a robust, user-friendly toolset ensuring that your endpoints are not only swiftly constructed but also meticulously tested and validated, reflecting a commitment to quality and reliability in your development workflow.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Key Features

- **Streamlined Setup**: With just a few lines of code, your **CRUD** operations are ready to roll. No more copy-pasting or reinventing the wheel for each project.
- **Focus on What Matters**: Spend your precious time solving real problems, not stitching together basic operations. Django Ninja CRUD is like a trusty sidekick, handling the routine while you strategize the big picture.
- **Reliable Code**: Predefined blueprints are battle-tested and developer-approved. They're customizable, transparent, and designed with best practices in mind.
- **Integrated Testing Framework**: A robust, user-friendly toolset ensures that your endpoints are not only swiftly constructed but also meticulously tested and validated, reflecting a commitment to quality and reliability in your development workflow.
